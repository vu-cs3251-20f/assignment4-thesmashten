/**
 * Forward declarations.
 *
 * To understand why these are necessary, think about the compilation process
 * and how dependencies are instantiated. When a LinkedList<T> is instantiated,
 * a LinkedListIterator<T> and LinkedListConstIterator<T> must also be
 * instantiated, but they cannot be instantiated without a complete
 * LinkedList<T>, and so on it goes.
 *
 * To get around the mutual dependency issue, we use a trick called a "forward
 * declaration" - we simply declare that the class exists (without providing any
 * details about it!) and tell the compiler "we'll feed you the symbol
 * definitions later - just use this as a placeholder for now", and #include the
 * dependency once we're done, leaving it up to the compiler to fill in the
 * blanks.

/**
 * An node-backed list implementation. This class attempts to provide certain
 * levels of exception safety (consult each method documentation for specifics)
 * and as such several assumptions are made:
 *
 * 1. The parameterizing type has a default constructor.
 * 2. The parameterizing type has a copy constructor.
 * 3. The parameterizing type has an assignment operator.
 * 4. The parameterizing type has a no-throw destructor.
 * 5. The parameterizing type has proper copy semantics.
 *
 * Note that you can make no other assumptions about the behavior of the
 * parameterizing type (including its behavior with respect to exceptions)
 * beyond those made here.
 *
 * To eliminate complex edge cases, this LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-
 * linked, circular chain of nodes that always contains a "dummy" node. With
 * this approach we never have to worry about checking for head and tail or
 * empty conditions. The node class is designed in such a way as to reduce the
 * amount of code in the actual list implementation.
 *
 * Implementation note 1: mTail should always point to the dummy node.
 * Implementation note 2: mTail->next should always point to the head node.
 *
 * Due to this node structure, most of the operations performed on the
 * LinkedList can execute safely without making backup copies of the list.
 *
 * This class provides a set of STL-style iterators. As with most
 * iterator implementations, modifying the LinkedList while iterating over it
 * invalidates all current iterators. Attempts to use invalidated iterators
 * constitutes undefined behavior.
